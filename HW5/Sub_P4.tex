Similiar to that in (c), we may obtian the SIR for each signal under $N_r = 64$ received antenna.
The SIR of each signal is listed in the table below:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
        & Signal 1 & Signal 2 & Signal 3 & Signal 4 & Signal 5 \\  
             \hline 
    SIR (dB) & 21.2980  & 16.7495  & 23.8789  & 21.1201  & 16.7325  
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Compared to that in problem 3, it can be observed that the SIR for 
each signal increases as the number of receiving antennas increases.
